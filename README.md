## About Me

I'm Ismaël Perez, a passionate front-end developer with a keen eye for crafting engaging digital experiences. After retraining as a developer 3 years ago, I recently graduated from the web developer bootcamp at Le Wagon in Bordeaux, France. My skills span PHP (Laravel), Ruby (Rails), JS (React), Next.js and TypeScript. With dual French and Spanish citizenship, I bring diverse cultural insights into every project I undertake.

## Current Focus

- **Personal Projects**: I'm developing a platform to exhibit an analog photography project that captures scenes from Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Mexico, and Colombia.
